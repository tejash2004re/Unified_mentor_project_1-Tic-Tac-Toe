Project Description:
In this project, you will design and implement a classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet engaging game that will allow you to practice
your front-end web development skills.
Project Objectives:
● Create a user-friendly interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML and CSS.
● Implement the game logic in JavaScript, allowing two players to take turns and determine
the winner.
● Ensure that the game is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
Project Requirements:
HTML Structure:
● Create the game board with a 3x3 grid of cells for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
● Include a display area to show the current player's turn and the game result (win,
tie, or ongoing).
CSS Styling:
● Style the game board, cells, and display area to make it visually appealing.
● Use CSS for responsive design to ensure the game works on various screen sizes.

● Check for a win condition (three in a row, column, or diagonal) or a tie.
● Display the game result when a player wins or when the game ends in a tie.
● Provide a button to reset the game for a new round.
User Interaction:
● Allow players to click on empty cells to make their moves.
● Prevent further moves after a game has ended (win or tie).
Project Guidelines:
● Start by creating the HTML structure and CSS styling to set up the game interface.
● Implement the game logic in JavaScript, including functions to handle player moves,
check for win conditions, and update the game status.
● Ensure that your game is responsive and works on different screen sizes.
● Test your game thoroughly to make sure it functions correctly and displays the results
accurately.
● Include comments in your code to explain the different sections and functions.
Project Submission:
You should submit a ZIP file containing the following:
● HTML file (index.html) for the game structure.
● CSS file (style.css) for the game styling.
● JavaScript file (script.js) for the game logic.
● Any additional assets or images you used.
Evaluation Criteria:
Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
● Functionality: Does the game work correctly, Can players take turns and win or tie as
expected
● User Interface: Is the game visually appealing and user-friendly
● Responsiveness: Does the game work on both desktop and mobile devices
